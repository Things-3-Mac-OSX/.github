## What is Things 3?

**Things 3** is a personal and professional planning system — crafted specifically to keep your brain unloaded. Unlike typical to-do apps that just generate lists, Things 3 offers an architecture where organizing feels light: Areas, Projects, Headings, powerful filters, tasks that can nest, tagging that scales — all clearly visualized and fast to use.

Many people who move into **things 3 mac app** come from more complex productivity software, and find that Things is the perfect balance — flexible enough to run entire GTD setups, but gentle enough to work for personal life and weekend planning.

A keyboard shortcut can instantly throw an idea, task, or note into Things, no matter where you are on your Mac — helping maintain flow. And because it’s a first-party native app, interactions feel instant, reliable, and safe for long-term planning.
